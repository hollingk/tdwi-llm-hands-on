# Lab 1: The Art of Prompting

## Overview

Welcome to Lab 1 of our Hands-on workshop for customizing LLMs. In this session, you'll dive into the world of prompting large language models (LLMs), gaining some initial familiarity with effectively communicating with LLMs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
1. Craft effective prompts for diverse AI applications
2. Understand and apply various prompting techniques
3. Gain insights into AI safety through hands-on experience
